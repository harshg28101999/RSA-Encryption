# RSA-Encryption

RSA is abbreviated as Rivest–Shamir–Adleman which is an alogorithm that is used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone.

This project contains different functions: 

## def gcd(a, b)

The function gcd(a, b), use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers a and b. The return type is an integer. 

## def inverse(a, b)

The function inverse(a, b), use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of a mod b. The return type is an integer.
